   <h1>My Cats</h1>

      <p>Studying cats is a passion of mine. It started from when I was younger 
       and my parents had two cats named Pepper and Freddy. Pepper was what most people would call a cow cat: black and white.
      Freddy was all light grey. She was an old cat who did not enjoy attention and who hated children. My dad qoutes "Freddy was a minimal cat.".
      Pepper was an excellent cat who enjoyed any kind of attention. As a kid I was fascinated by how Pepper was so chill and friendly.
      Eventually both cats passed away, Freddy to old age and Pepper had a heart attack.
      The next couple of cats in the family were Josie and Poco. </p>
  
      <p> Both were adopted as tabby kittens from the APA Missouri shelter that is on Brentwood.
      The APA website is here: <a href="https://apamo.org/">APA Brentwood</a>. 
      Josie was a black tabby while Poco was a very orange tabby. Poco was very skilled at playing fetch and would happily run
      up and down the hall playing with yellow pom-poms. Josie excelled at napping and generally being more cuddly than her brother.

   After Poco passed away from kidney disease in 2016, we got Mr. Tims from a neighbor in October 2020. He was found in downtown Saint Louis, 
   my sister and I begged our parents to take him in because he was very small and looked so cute and helpless. His full name is Timothy, but 
   he goes by Mr. Tims on a regular basis. Timothy bothers Josie on a regular basis and steals her food.

          Then as I got older I yearned for independance and my own cat.
         As soon as I got my own place, I immediately went to the shelter to
          look for a cat to take home. There I met Sir Reginald and they told me that he was given up twice! 
          Once because he did not get along with small cats and children. The other time apparently he marked his owner's side 
          of the bed when the owner brought a new man home. I assured them Reginald would be an only child and pampered at my place. 
          I had him for a trial run of two weeks and after the first week decided that this cat would stay with me.

     <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> Expensive baby, but so worth it.
      We're not even including food, litter, toys 
      (stupid pet marketing, he only likes one toy. His only favorite is a fuzzy worm on a stick), catnip habit. </p>
